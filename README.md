# linheritance: the game
Laboratory task for the Software Construction course.

To launch the project, either clone the main branch and *run the run.bat file* or:

- switch to the build branch
- download and unpack the Inheritance.zip
- run the Inheritance.exe file.

This project extends the parser class provided by the course lead, building gameplay around the text-input mechanic.
